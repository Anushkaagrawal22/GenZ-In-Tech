# Competitive Coding
## Learn a programming language
Learn a programming language first. Most participants in programming competitions use C++. The second most used language for programming in a competitive environment is Java. I advise you to choose between C++ and Java. Avoid using Python or JavaScript because they haven't been tested for most tasks and many competitions don't even accept them. 
## Practice coding on an online platform
The way coding is taught in the classroom is considerably different from how it is written on internet sites. Additionally, there are several issues that you would typically not run into when writing offline because you would not typically test in a limited manner. Warm up by addressing some practise questions that demand logical problem-solving without any prior knowledge.
## Solve practice problems on CodeChef
Start using CodeChef to solve simple and basic tasks. There are no prerequisites for the early problems because they are ad hoc problems. You can resolve them using simple reasoning or fundamental math. Solve the first 30 problems from both the beginner and easy levels. Problem-solving may take some time at first. It's okay to continue being stuck and eventually find a solution after making the effort. You'll become a better problem-solver as a result. You might even run across various problems. Your ally is Google.
With an average of 4 problems per day, this should take about 15 days.
## Start participating in CodeChef Long Challenges
You ought should be able to code online at this point without too much difficulty. Even if you aren't very good at problem-solving, you will at least be aware of the typical difficulties and how to test and debug them. Always start with the simplest problems in a competition.
You have 10 days to find solutions in the CodeChef Long Challenge, which is a fantastic learning opportunity. If you can only solve one problem, it is okay too. To address as many issues as you can in a given amount of time.
Please read the editorials for the following three problems after a contest and attempt to comprehend how to solve them. After reading the editorial, try to find solutions to those issues in the practical area. If the solution to that problem necessitates a concept that you are unfamiliar with (usually a data structure or algorithm), research that subject and attempt to answer a few related questions.
To keep learning, keep doing this as long as you can.
## Start participating in short contests across websites
The true thing about competitive programming is shorter competitions. Only by taking part in quick competitions can you develop into a good competitive coder (2 to 2.5 hours).
You should concentrate on taking part in as many contests as you can across platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc. after a few protracted contests. Even if you start and are unable to solve even one problem, it's okay. By reading the editorial and resolving the following two or three unsolved difficulties, concentrate on getting better with each contest. It is a lifelong learning process. The ideas would become more complicated as you began to solve more and more issues.
As long as you can, keep doing this to maintain improving.
## Good problem sets for practice (Intermediate/Advanced):

## Common mistakes to avoid in competitive programming as a beginner
The common errors newcomers in competitive programming should steer clear of are as follows:<br/>
- Over-emphasizing the programming language <br/>
- Practice only; no learning <br/>
- No practising, only learning <br/>
- Only taking part in competitions <br/>
- Not taking part in competitions <br/>
- Answering arbitrary questions <br/>
- Dropping out
