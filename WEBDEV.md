# WEB DEVELOPMENT
The Web Development Roadmap 2022 will be covered. Let's start! Here is a detailed procedure:
- Pick a technology that you want to work with.
- Frontend Development
- Backend Development
- Database
- Version Control System
- Build Projects
## Choose a Technology
Database administration, the front end, and the back end are all parts of full stack development. The technology you decide to work with depends on you, your needs, and your applications. There are only a few popular technologies that you can work with:
The most well-liked and current technology is MERN.<br/>
MongoDB is a data-focused NoSQL database.<br/>
Express is a NodeJS framework that supports GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations.<br/>
React is a JavaScript package used to create single-page apps and user interfaces.<br/>
An open-source server environment is NodeJS.  
MERN vs. MEAN - MERN (written in JavaScript) works with React, whereas MEAN interacts with Angular. This is the main distinction between the two (a framework written in TypeScript).
## Frontend Development
Front-end is the UI (User Interface), which deals with how interactive and dynamic the website is, as well as how it looks overall. Learn everything there is to know about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to master it.
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) : By building a simple website with all the parts, begin by applying HTML in its most fundamental form. Play around with tables and forms, and try adding images and links to the website to make it more appealing, which will in turn help to streamline your work. 
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) : You must go through CSS if you're a creative person. You can use CSS to add colours to your website, give headers and paragraphs borders, create the navigation bar, alter the icons, font, and text, and do a lot more similar things. Make the website responsive, meaning that it should display properly on all screen sizes. Bootstrap is the most frequently used CSS framework.
- JavaScript : This is the web's primary programming language. Properly educate yourself on the DOM (Document Object Model) and API (Application Program Interface).
- Frameworks : It serves as a platform for creating software programmes. It consists of code libraries, compilers, and programmes that when combined allow for the creation of systems or projects. These frameworks enable the reuse of components. Frameworks include React, Angular, Vue, and more.
## Backend Development
The server's running code has logic that allows it to send the right data from the client and receive it from the server. It also contains the database, which houses all of the application's data. A server, an application, and a database make up its three components. In this case, developers' code sends data from the database to the browser. Back-end engineers write the code that transmits data from the database to the browser.
Back-end developer requirements include knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, databases, servers, and APIs (Application Program Interface).
- Programming Languages : Programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript should be at least somewhat familiar to back-end engineers. The ideal option would be JavaScript because it can be used in both the front-end and the back-end.
- Frameworks : Generally speaking, frameworks are parts or operations used to boost development efficiency. It comprises the tool and module library used to create a website's architecture. The back-end frameworks Express, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc. are a few well-liked ones.
- Database : Different DBMS technologies, including MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc., should be understood. It deals with the management and storage of data.
- Server : Clients across a network are any devices that provide data, services, or software. The data and information are exchanged (sent and received) between the client and server.
- API (Application Program Interface) : It is a collection of established guidelines that permits interaction or serves as a bridge between two apps. Response from the server completes the user's request.
Client-Server Architecture : This architecture has been created to comprehend both the request and the response. The server replies to requests for data made by the client-side whenever they are made. The image of a database, which is described in more detail in the following step, appears. This database contains the data that must be obtained.
## Database
We can manage data from the database, which is a collection of data (store and retrieve). Relational (SQL) and non-relational databases are the two categories (NoSQL). Popular databases include:
Relational database management systems, like MySQL, store and handle data.
The NoSQL database MongoDB finds key-value and graph databases.
VoltDB: It uses memory to store data and adheres to a relational design pattern.
## Version Control
Each programme gets updated over time when specific libraries are added, which results in the creation of a new version of the application. If you're working on applications, using Git is a very good practise. Git is an open-source system where the full code has been present since the beginning. It restores the code and is versatile, safe, and easy to edit. All of the files, including the codebase, are saved in repositories where they may be changed as needed. Anyone can work together and adjust things as needed.
Version Control Systems include the following:
- GitHub
- Apache Subversion 
- GitLab
- Beanstalk
- Mercurial
The advantages of version control:
- It aids in code maintenance.
- It can be used again whenever necessary.
- Saves the modifications.
- Demonstrates all the adjustments that were made.
- Enhances the efficiency of web development.
- Participate and work together.
## Build Projects
Build some projects after finishing the theory portion to gain experience with full-stack programming. When you implement all of a project's front-end, back-end, and database handling components, you become an expert in web development. As you construct anything, you gain technical knowledge about things like how databases store data, how APIs link the front end to the back end, and other procedures used in web development. Develop the habit of creating projects as a result to become a productive web developer.
