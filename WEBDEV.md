# WEB DEVELOPMENT
The Web Development Roadmap 2022 will be covered. Let's start! Here is a detailed procedure:
- Pick a technology that you want to work with.
- Frontend Development
- Backend Development
- Database
- Version Control System
- Build Projects
## Choose a Technology
Database administration, the front end, and the back end are all parts of full stack development. The technology you decide to work with depends on you, your needs, and your applications. There are only a few popular technologies that you can work with:
The most well-liked and current technology is MERN.<br/>
MongoDB is a data-focused NoSQL database.<br/>
Express is a NodeJS framework that supports GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations.<br/>
React is a JavaScript package used to create single-page apps and user interfaces.<br/>
An open-source server environment is NodeJS.  
MERN vs. MEAN - MERN (written in JavaScript) works with React, whereas MEAN interacts with Angular. This is the main distinction between the two (a framework written in TypeScript).
## Frontend Development
Front-end is the UI (User Interface), which deals with how interactive and dynamic the website is, as well as how it looks overall. Learn everything there is to know about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to master it.
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) : By building a simple website with all the parts, begin by applying HTML in its most fundamental form. Play around with tables and forms, and try adding images and links to the website to make it more appealing, which will in turn help to streamline your work. 
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) : You must go through CSS if you're a creative person. You can use CSS to add colours to your website, give headers and paragraphs borders, create the navigation bar, alter the icons, font, and text, and do a lot more similar things. Make the website responsive, meaning that it should display properly on all screen sizes. Bootstrap is the most frequently used CSS framework.
- JavaScript : This is the web's primary programming language. Properly educate yourself on the DOM (Document Object Model) and API (Application Program Interface).
- Frameworks : It serves as a platform for creating software programmes. It consists of code libraries, compilers, and programmes that when combined allow for the creation of systems or projects. These frameworks enable the reuse of components. Frameworks include React, Angular, Vue, and more.
