## Choose a Technology
Database administration, the front end, and the back end are all parts of full stack development. The technology you decide to work with depends on you, your needs, and your applications. There are only a few popular technologies that you can work with:
The most well-liked and current technology is MERN.<br/>
MongoDB is a data-focused NoSQL database.<br/>
Express is a NodeJS framework that supports GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations.<br/>
React is a JavaScript package used to create single-page apps and user interfaces.<br/>
An open-source server environment is NodeJS.  
MERN vs. MEAN - MERN (written in JavaScript) works with React, whereas MEAN interacts with Angular. This is the main distinction between the two (a framework written in TypeScript).
