## A Roadmap to Learn
Start with the Android Overview. Read some blogs on Android and do some Android-related research. For instance, read blogs on themes like Why Kotlin will replace Java for Android App Development, the History of Android, the Different Versions of Android, etc. to get a thorough mental picture before beginning your Android journey. Motivate yourself to learn Android and create some fantastic Android projects. Practice it frequently and begin to learn new Android concepts one at a time. It will be in your best interest to attend some conferences or workshops on Android before you set out on your adventure. Set a clear goal for yourself and work toward it.
