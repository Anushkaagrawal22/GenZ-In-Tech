# QUANTUM ENGINEERING
## What does it take to become a successful Quantum Engineer?
A person without a background in mathematics or quantum physics should focus on developing their intuition for the fundamental ideas of quantum computing and how to use it to their advantage.<br/>  The position of a quantum engineer requires extensive training as well as technical, business, and soft abilities. More information about each topic is provided below.
## Educational Background
### STEM : 
Any field within the STEM fields—Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Information Technology—is referred to as STEM. It is desirable to have a master's or doctorate in science, but a bachelor's degree in engineering with computer science or electronics is necessary.
### Quantum Mechanics/Physics/ Chemistry :
Quantum mechanics, physics, and chemistry are desirable skill sets. The fundamental physics theory of quantum mechanics gives an atomic and subatomic level account of nature. Quantum computing makes use of the intricate laws of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, superposition, teleportation, and others.
## Technical Skills
### Programming skillset:
Although a PhD is not necessary for becoming a quantum engineer, it is crucial to have a solid command of programming languages like Python, R, and quantum SDKs like Qiskit (IBM), Pennylane (Xanadu), Cirq (Google), and/or TensorFlow (Google).
In order to programme, Classical Computing Languages like Python, C, and C++ are primarily needed. SDKs like Qiskit and Cirq support these languages.
Quantum programming languages are, nevertheless, widely divided into:
- Imperative Quantum Programming Language
- Functional Quantum Programming Language
- Multi-Paradigm Languages
Running quantum circuits on simulators or creating quantum device prototypes both require quantum software development kits.
