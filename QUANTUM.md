# QUANTUM ENGINEERING
## What does it take to become a successful Quantum Engineer?
A person without a background in mathematics or quantum physics should focus on developing their intuition for the fundamental ideas of quantum computing and how to use it to their advantage.<br/>  The position of a quantum engineer requires extensive training as well as technical, business, and soft abilities. More information about each topic is provided below.
## Educational Background
### STEM : 
Any field within the STEM fields—Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Information Technology—is referred to as STEM. It is desirable to have a master's or doctorate in science, but a bachelor's degree in engineering with computer science or electronics is necessary.
### Quantum Mechanics/Physics/ Chemistry :
Quantum mechanics, physics, and chemistry are desirable skill sets. The fundamental physics theory of quantum mechanics gives an atomic and subatomic level account of nature. Quantum computing makes use of the intricate laws of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, superposition, teleportation, and others.
## Technical Skills
### Programming skillset:
Although a PhD is not necessary for becoming a quantum engineer, it is crucial to have a solid command of programming languages like Python, R, and quantum SDKs like Qiskit (IBM), Pennylane (Xanadu), Cirq (Google), and/or TensorFlow (Google).
In order to programme, Classical Computing Languages like Python, C, and C++ are primarily needed. SDKs like Qiskit and Cirq support these languages.
Quantum programming languages are, nevertheless, widely divided into:
- Imperative Quantum Programming Language
- Functional Quantum Programming Language
- Multi-Paradigm Languages
Basic Mathematical Ideas A desirable skill set includes knowledge of probability, complex numbers, and linear algebra.
All fields of quantum technology, such as ion traps, cavity QED, NMR, photonics quantum computers, and solid-state systems, can benefit from quantum information and computation, which includes quantum algorithms, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and information processing. Quantum Information Theory, Physical Realizations, and Quantum Mechanics are all covered by QIC. to create and implement an enterprise AI-quantum strategy, they transformed into quantum engineers.
With 50–100 qubits that can carry out sophisticated operations and outperform the capabilities of conventional computing, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) ushers in the "NISQ" era of quantum computing. More accurate and less obtrusive fault-tolerant quantum systems are a goal for quantum engineers and quantum hardware producers.

Building hybrid environments of classical and quantum computing methods involves a large amount of AI and machine learning. As quantum technology develops, more AI engineers must become quantum engineers in order to develop and implement enterprise AI-quantum strategy.
## Business Skills
Quantum engineers must be able to persuade others of the advantages and compatibility of their solutions with corporate objectives.
Communication: Effective written and verbal communication skills
Ability to collaborate with a wide group of engineers, scientists, and business stakeholders.
Thinking Analytically and Logically
Study Papers: involvement in research publications and prior professional experience in an R&D environment
Support for the Scientific Community: From a Software Engineer to a Quantum Engineer, you must actively communicate, collaborate, give back to communities (such GitHub, Qiskit Community, etc.), publish research papers, and review them.
## Soft Skills
Soft skills are a broad category of abstract knowledge that are essential for the development of both a person and an organisation. Major characteristics for a successful transition into quantum engineering include the capacity and drive to learn, the curiosity to explore, the determination, the growth mindset, the capacity to work in a team, the capacity to express, and the capacity to communicate.
A crucial component is networking; you need to know people who can introduce you to the appropriate people.
Learning is a prerequisite for quantum engineering, which is a rigorous branch of science. Compared to five years ago, there are a huge number of resources on the internet, and that number is only growing. One of those sources is the [Quantum Strategy Institute](https://quantumstrategyinstitute.com).
