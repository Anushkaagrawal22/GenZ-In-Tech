          <h3 class="sub-subtitle">What is Git? -</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">Git is officially defined as a distributed version control system (VCS).</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">In other words, it's a system that tracks changes to our project files over time. It enables us to record project changes and go back to a specific version of the tracked files, at any given point in time. This system can be used by many people to efficiently work together and collaborate on team projects, where each developer can have their own version of the project, distributed on their computer. Later on, these individual versions of the project can be merged and adapted into the main version of the project.</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">Basically, it's a massively popular tool for coordinating parallel work and managing projects among individuals and teams. Needless to say, knowing how to use Git is one of the most important skills for any developer nowadays - and it's definitely a great addition to your resume!</h3>

          <h3 class="sub-subtitle">What is Github?</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories. You can use Git on its own without Github (and other similar platforms), but it's difficult to collaborate or share your code with. others.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Git is the version control system, the tool that tracks changes to our files over time</li>
            <li>Github is a hosting service for projects that use Git.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">** Make sure to first familiarize yourself with Git before proceeding.</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">Git is used to store projects inside repositories and track the complete history of all changes to the project code. Using GitHub, we can upload a local project repository to a remote cloud-based GitHub repository. We can also interact with public repositories published by other developers.</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">GitHub could even be looked at as a social networking website for developers. Users can follow each other, give ratings, collaborate and communicate.</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">GitHub allows developers to utilize, change or improve software from its repositories. Each repository contains all project files and the code history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</h3>
          <h3 class="sub-sub-subtitle">GitHub is also a popular way developers to publish their project portfolio online. It's an easy way to showcase skills and experience to potential employers or clients. It's an important technology to be familiar with, especially for a new developer who is just starting out.</h3>
