This repository is the perfect roadmap for anyone who hasn't started coding yet but is very persistent in achieving something in the technical field. So here is the ideal material to explore every specialized area. It will help everyone across the globe and encourage them to pursue the field further.

### Competitive Coding
# Learn a programming language
Start by learning a programming language. Most competitive programmers participate using C++. Java is the second most popular language for competitive programming. I suggest you pick either C++ or Java. Avoid languages like Python or JavaScript, as most problems are not tested for those languages, and many contests don't even allow those languages.
# Practice coding on an online platform
Writing code on online judges is very different from how coding is taught in the classroom. Additionally, there are specific errors that you would mostly not encounter while coding offline as you would generally not test in a constrained manner while coding offline. Warm up by solving some practice questions which require you to solve logical problems without any prerequisite.
# Solve practice problems on CodeChef
Start solving beginner and easy problems on CodeChef. The initial problems are ad-hoc problems and don't have any prerequisites. You can solve them based on basic maths or simple logic. Solve the first 30 problems from beginner and the first 30 problems from easy. Initially, it might take some time to solve problems. It is fine to stay stuck and ultimately solve after putting in the effort. That will make you a better problem-solver. You may even encounter different types of issues. Google is your friend.
This should take around 15 days, with an average of 4 problems per day.
# Start participating in CodeChef Long Challenges
At this stage, you should be pretty comfortable with online coding. You might not be able to solve many problems, but you will still know the common issues and how to test and debug them. In a contest, always start with the easiest problems.
CodeChef Long Challenge is a great way to learn; you will get 10 days to solve problems. It is fine even if you can solve only a single problem. The idea is to solve as many problems as possible with time.
After a contest, please go through the editorials of the next three problems and try to understand how to solve them. After going through the editorial, try to solve those problems in the practice section. If that problem requires a concept that you are not aware of (most likely a data structure or algorithm), learn about it and solve a few questions that require that concept.
Continue doing this as long as possible to keep learning.
# Start participating in short contests across websites
Shorter contests are the real thing in Competitive Programming. You can become a good competitive programmer only by participating in short contests (2 to 2.5 hours).
After a couple of long contests, you should focus on participating in as many contests as possible across platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc. It is ok even if you cannot solve a single problem when you start. Focus on improving with every contest by going through the editorial and solving the next 2-3 unsolved problems. It is a continuous journey of learning. As you start solving more and more problems, the concepts would get more complex.
Continue doing this as long as possible to keep getting better.
