# Competitive Coding
### Learn a programming language
Start by learning a programming language. Most competitive programmers participate using C++. Java is the second most popular language for competitive programming. I suggest you pick either C++ or Java. Avoid languages like Python or JavaScript, as most problems are not tested for those languages, and many contests don't even allow those languages.
### Practice coding on an online platform
Writing code on online judges is very different from how coding is taught in the classroom. Additionally, there are specific errors that you would mostly not encounter while coding offline as you would generally not test in a constrained manner while coding offline. Warm up by solving some practice questions which require you to solve logical problems without any prerequisite.
### Solve practice problems on CodeChef
Start solving beginner and easy problems on CodeChef. The initial problems are ad-hoc problems and don't have any prerequisites. You can solve them based on basic maths or simple logic. Solve the first 30 problems from beginner and the first 30 problems from easy. Initially, it might take some time to solve problems. It is fine to stay stuck and ultimately solve after putting in the effort. That will make you a better problem-solver. You may even encounter different types of issues. Google is your friend.
This should take around 15 days, with an average of 4 problems per day.
### Start participating in CodeChef Long Challenges
You ought should be able to code online at this point without too much difficulty. Even if you aren't very good at problem-solving, you will at least be aware of the typical difficulties and how to test and debug them. Always start with the simplest problems in a competition.
You have 10 days to find solutions in the CodeChef Long Challenge, which is a fantastic learning opportunity. If you can only solve one problem, it is okay too. To address as many issues as you can in a given amount of time.
Please read the editorials for the following three problems after a contest and attempt to comprehend how to solve them. After reading the editorial, try to find solutions to those issues in the practical area. If the solution to that problem necessitates a concept that you are unfamiliar with (usually a data structure or algorithm), research that subject and attempt to answer a few related questions.
To keep learning, keep doing this as long as you can.
### Start participating in short contests across websites
The true thing about competitive programming is shorter competitions. Only by taking part in quick competitions can you develop into a good competitive coder (2 to 2.5 hours).
You should concentrate on taking part in as many contests as you can across platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc. after a few protracted contests. Even if you start and are unable to solve even one problem, it's okay. By reading the editorial and resolving the following two or three unsolved difficulties, concentrate on getting better with each contest. It is a lifelong learning process. The ideas would become more complicated as you began to solve more and more issues.
As long as you can, keep doing this to maintain improving.
### Good problem sets for practice (Intermediate/Advanced):

### Common mistakes to avoid in competitive programming as a beginner
The common errors newcomers in competitive programming should steer clear of are as follows:<br/>
Over-emphasizing the programming language <br/>
Practice only; no learning <br/>
No practising, only learning <br/>
Only taking part in competitions <br/>
Not taking part in competitions <br/>
Answering arbitrary questions <br/>
